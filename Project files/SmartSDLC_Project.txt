**1. Introduction:**  
Software development today requires faster iterations, better quality, and efficient management. SmartSDLC is a proposed AI-powered framework that enhances every phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to automate routine tasks, improve accuracy, and speed up delivery.

---

**2. Objective:**  
To develop an AI-integrated model for SDLC that assists in planning, designing, coding, testing, and maintenance with intelligent automation and decision-making support.

---

**3. Key Features:**  
- AI-based requirement analysis and documentation  
- Automated code generation using AI models  
- Predictive bug detection and quality assurance  
- Smart test case generation  
- AI-assisted project timeline and resource planning  
- Chatbot assistant for developer and user queries

**4. Modules:**  
1. **Requirement Analysis:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to convert client requirements into structured formats.  
2. **Design:** AI tools recommend design patterns and system architecture based on requirements.  
3. **Development:** Integration of code generation tools like GitHub Copilot or custom AI models.  
4. **Testing:** AI-generated test cases, bug prediction, and automated regression testing.  
5. **Deployment:** Smart deployment suggestions and CI/CD pipeline optimization.  
6. **Maintenance:** Error log analysis and AI-driven updates suggestions.
